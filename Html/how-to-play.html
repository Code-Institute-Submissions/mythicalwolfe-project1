            <p>
                Tile cards act as <strong>movement </strong>spaces, the tiles have a variety of terrains, encounters and hostiles.
                There are a total of 52 tiles in a deck and each card has 2 tiles! at the start of a players turn they pick up a tile card and place it somewhere on the playable map.
                the tiles are:
                <li>Movement Tiles</li>
                <li>Enemy Tiles</li>
                <li>Encounter Tiles</li>
                <li>Dead End Tiles</li>
                <li>Effect Tiles</li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Movement</strong> tiles allow players to move throughout the map, however when a player encounters a <strng>Dead End</strng> tile it prevents any movement in that direction and can no longer have tiles placed connecting to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Encounter</strong> tiles have a variety of different chances, 
                        players can come across <strong>Traders</strong> allowing them to buy and sell equipement and items, 
                        <br>
                        <strong>Quests</strong> Some encounters will have quests attached giving players rewards on completion these can be found in towns too, 
                        <br>
                        <strong>Skill</strong> encounters have 2 different types: Players can come across a multiple choice skill based test or a test of their base special stats, depending on the outcome will affect the reward given, 
                        <br> 
                        <strong>Carnival</strong> The carnival is a unique encounter that allows players to attempt games to gain rewards once per person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Tile cards can also have some negative affects: 
                    <strong>Hostile</strong> tiles, these tiles will spawn a monster which players draw from a card deck which will give a random level monster (0-2) for the current version there are only a few monsters.
                    Mnsters will do damage each turn they are left on the board, players can als gain <strong>Items and Equipement</strong> after defeating them.
                    <br>Monster levels are random and not determined on a players level or stats.
                <br>
            <br>
        The other negative tile is a <strong>Effect</strong> tile, this will inflict a status ailement on a player when they land on this tile, these can be a variety of deadly conconctions. Burn, Poison, Slow or even Weakness affects.</p>
